# RealTimeTempandHumidity
Real time Temperature and humidity using NodeMCU , DHT-11 , Firebase and Android.


First Work with "NodeMcu_With_DHT11.ino" so that you will connect Nodemcu with DHT_11 Sensor. you can see real time time data in Serial print of Adruino IDE.

then Work with "FirebaseWithNodeMCU_P-02.ino" so that you can push data into Firebase cloud.
Note:- Copy Database URL from realtime Database and paste into  "https://www.grc.com/fingerprints.htm" this website then update Fingerprint in "FirebaseHttpClient.h" file which is on below path
"C:\Users\**\Documents\Arduino\libraries\firebase-arduino-master\src" to avoid setting/number failed error.
